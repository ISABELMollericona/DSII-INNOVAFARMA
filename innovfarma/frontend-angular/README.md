Angular scaffold for Innovfarma — placeholders converted from Blade views.

How to run:

1. cd frontend-angular
2. npm install
3. npm start    # runs `npx ng serve --open`

Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold using Angular standalone components (Angular 16+).
- You may need a working Node.js and npm installation and the angular/cli devDependency will be used by npx.
- The app expects the backend API at http://127.0.0.1:5000 (update services accordingly).
